PrimeSequence class

PrimeSequence constructor
   take one (two?) int parameters to determine where to start the sequence


next()
   perform continuous modulus operations until the result the divisor is greater than half the current number (meaning it's prime). If the operation returns zero, exit the loop (not prime)
      Check that someNumber  * 2 is not greater than the current value (if so, exit loop)
      If the current value % someNumber is not 0, increase someNumber
   update the current number of the sequence
   return the current number of the sequence

getNumber()
   get the current value of the sequence

setNumber()
   set the value that the sequence should begin at

clearSequence()
   clear the current number of the sequence
