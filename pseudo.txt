PrimeSequence class

PrimeSequence constructor
   take one (two?) int parameters to determine where to start the sequence


next()
   increment the current value
   perform continuous modulus operations until the result the divisor is greater than half the current number (meaning it's prime). 
      Check that someNumber  * 2 is not greater than the current value (if so, exit loop)
      If the current value % someNumber is 0, current value is not prime so increase it and reset the divisor
      Otherwise, increment the divisor
   return the current value

getNumber()
   get the current value of the sequence

setNumber()
   set the value that the sequence should begin at

clearSequence()
   clear the current number of the sequence 


SequenceDemo class

main()
   High level view of program operation

isValid()
   validate command line input.
   Ensure that two integer arguments are provided and, if not, close the program.

generateSequence()
   retrieve the command line arguments
   generate the sequence and output the results as an array.
